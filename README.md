# ECE-GY-6953 Deep Leaning Final Project : Discriminating Deepfake detection
Deep Learning Final Project for the team:
Avinash Vijayarangan (av3134), Chinmay Nivsarkar (cmn8525), Nishal Sundarraman (ns5429)

To train the GAN from scratch, kindly download the dataset from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/celeba-dataset?resource=download. 
To train the pretrained model DenseNet-121, kindly download the dataset from: https://www.kaggle.com/c/deepfake-detection-challenge/discussion/121173. 
Training can be done using the discriminator_as_a_classifier.ipynb. It also can perform the validation on the comparison dataset.

The standard approach to deefake detection has been to train a classifier from scratch. We have a pretrained classifier for deepfakes available in dd_pretrained_densenet. It can perform validation on the common dataset to comment about accuracy.
